🔹 About This Project
This device is designed as an ESP8266-based WiFi Security Testing and Research Tool. It allows users to analyze, monitor, and improve their own network security.

✅ Supports ESP8266-based boards (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)
✅ Open-source firmware for educational cybersecurity research
✅ OLED Display + Button control for on-device interaction

📌 No software is preinstalled. Users must flash firmware manually.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure you have:

ESP8266 board (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)
USB cable (for flashing)
Computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
Flashing software (ESPTool or NodeMCU PyFlasher)
🔹 How to Flash Firmware
This guide will show you how to install WiFi security research software onto your ESP8266.

1️⃣ Install Required Tools
To flash firmware, install:

ESPTool (Python-based)
nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install esptool
Or download NodeMCU PyFlasher for a graphical interface.
2️⃣ Download the Open-Source Firmware
For software installation, visit:
📌 Official Firmware Repository

👉 Do not download or use this software on unauthorized networks.

3️⃣ Flashing the Firmware
Using ESPTool, run:

css
Copy
Edit
esptool.py --port COMx --baud 115200 write_flash 0x00000 firmware.bin
(Replace COMx with your actual port, e.g., COM3 on Windows or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux.)

Using NodeMCU PyFlasher:

Select the ESP8266 board and COM port.
Choose the firmware.bin file.
Set baud rate to 115200.
Click Flash.
4️⃣ Restart and Test Your Device
